Markup :  ## About Me ##

I am new to the College of Journalism and Communications' graduate program at the University of Florida. However, I am not new to the college. I am an alumnus of the institution as I have graduated with my advertising degree from the school back in May 2020. Yes, I did pick the worst time to enter the real world. I have enjoyed technology my whole life and I love to create things so this course is right up my alley in terms of where I want to be. 

Markup :  ## Past Coding Experience ##

I have not coded a day in my life. Well actually, that's not true. I have explored with the HTML settings in Squarespace and Wix and I am the first to mess something up in inspect element whenever I see it. However, for the purposes of this course. I am a coding virgin.
