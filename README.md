Markup :  ## About Me ##

I am new to the College of Journalism and Communications' graduate program at the University of Florida. However, I am not new to the college. I am an alumnus of the institution as I have graduated with my advertising degree from the school back in May 2020. Yes, I did pick the worst time to enter the real world. I have enjoyed technology my whole life and I love to create things so this course is right up my alley in terms of where I want to be. 

Markup :  ## Past Coding Experience ##

I have not coded a day in my life. Well actually that's not true
